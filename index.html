  <h1>TikZiT</h1>
  <p>TikZiT is a super simple GUI editor for graphs and string diagrams. Its native file format is a subset of PGF/TikZ, which means TikZiT files can be included directly in papers typeset using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. Pre-built versions of the Desktop application, as well as a <b>Visual Studio Code extension</b>, are available for systems running Windows, Linux, or macOS. <a href="#install">Packages</a> are available for some Linux distributions, or you can <a href="https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit">build from source</a>.</p>

<a name="install" class="anchor"></a>

<h1>Install</h1>

<p><b>Windows:</b> Click 'Windows (exe)' above to download a zip file and extract it to a convenient place (e.g. <code>C:\tikzit</code>). If you wish to associate <code>.tikz</code> files with TikZiT, run the included <code>.reg</code> file (optional). Note you may need to edit the <code>.reg</code> file with a text editor if you place TikZiT in a different location. You can also install with <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> via <code>choco install tikzit</code>.</p>

<p><b>Linux:</b> If you do not wish to <a href="https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit">build from source</a>, click 'Linux (portable binary)' above to download a tarball and extract it to a convient place (e.g. your home directory). Then, launch the application with <code>~/tikzit/bin/tikzit</code> (assuming you extracted into your home directory). You may wish to add <code>~/tikzit/bin</code> to your PATH and install the application launcher and file associations by running <code>./install-local.sh</code> from inside the TikZiT directory.</p>

<p>There are also packages available for several Linux distributions, maintained by volunteers in the open source community. Here are the ones I know about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 19.10+, Debian <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/buster">testing</a>/<a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/sid">unstable</a>: <code>apt install tikzit</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">arch linux</a>: <code>pacman -S tikzit</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a>: <code>nix-env -i tikzit</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> 32: <code>yum install tikzit</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a package maintainer for another distro, get in touch and I will add instructions here.</p>


<p><b>macOS:</b> Click 'macOS (dmg)' above to download a dmg file. Open this file and copy <code>tikzit.app</code> to your Applications folder. Depending on your system settings, the first time you run TikZiT, you may need to right-click the <code>.app</code> file and select <code>Open</code> from the menu to get the option to run it. After this, you can run TikZiT like a normal application. You can also install with <a href="https://brew.sh/">HomeBrew</a> by running <code>brew install tikzit</code> in a terminal.</p>

<div class="callout callout-warning">
  <p><b>Note:</b> The version of TikZiT above requires at least macOS version 10.11 (Yosemite). If you are running an older version of macOS (10.8-10.10), use <a href="https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit/releases/download/v2.0/tikzit-osx-mountain.dmg">this version</a> instead. However, to get the latest version of TikZiT, it is recommended to update your operating system.</p>
</div>


<a name="quickstart" class="anchor"></a>

<h1>Quickstart</h1>

<p>While TikZiT is easy to use, a few things might not be obvious the first time you run the program. This guide should get you going as quickly as possible. <b>For mac users:</b> throughout this tutorial, substitute <kbd>ctrl</kbd> = <kbd>command</kbd> and <kbd>alt</kbd> = <kbd>option</kbd>, as usual.</p>

<p>This tutorial will cover basic editing all the way up to building a LaTeX paper with TikZiT figures in it. Create a new, empty folder somewhere on your computer (which I will refer to as <code>tikzpaper</code> throughout this tutorial). Download <a href="tikzit.sty">tikzit.sty</a> and place it in the folder. Also, create a new sub-directory called <code>figures</code>, which we will use later.</p>

<a name="editing" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Basic node and edge editing</h2>

<p>When you open TikZiT for the first time, you will see something that looks like this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/fresh.png" />

<p>The window is divided into two parts: the main part is the <b>graph editor</b> and the part along the side is the <b>style palette</b>. For editing graphs, there are 3 tools: the <b>select</b> tool, the add <b>node</b> tool, and the add <b>edge</b> tool. These can be selected quickly by pressing <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, or <kbd>e</kbd> while the graph editor is in focus.</p>

<p>Pick the <b>node</b> tool and click on the graph a few times to add some nodes. You will notice these appear in TikZiT as dashed circles with a small dot in the middle. These are called <b>invisible nodes</b>. These will not appear in the actual typeset output. However, they can be labelled with pieces of LaTeX code (see below), which will appear in your figure, or used to attach edges. To add edges, select the <b>edge</b> tool and click and drag from one node to another.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/add-edge.png" />

<p>Pick the <b>select</b> tool again. You can select individual nodes or edges by clicking on them. You can select multiple nodes by dragging a box around the, and you can select multiple nodes or edges by clicking while holding down the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key.</p>

<p>Selected nodes can be moved by dragging the mouse, or by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys. Nodes are locked on a grid, so they normally only move in increments of 0.25 in TikZ coordinates. However, they can be "nudged" by increments of 0.025 by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + arrow keys. This is convenient e.g. for centering nodes between others (5 nudges = 1/2 normal grid cell).</p>

<p>Double-clicking a node gives the ability to set a label, which can contain LaTeX code:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/node-label.png" />

<p>Clicking on an edge reveals extra controls for bending the edge. There are two kinds of bend-modes in TikZiT, the <i>basic bend</i> mode (blue controls). Dragging either of the control points will cause the edge to bend to the left or the right:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/basic-bend.png" />

<p>Double-clicking the edge will change it to <i>bezier bend</i> mode (green controls). Now, each of the control points can be dragged independently:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/bezier-bend.png" />


<a name="styles" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Adding styles</h2>

<p>Before we can create non-invisible nodes, we will need some styles. To set up styles, we will first create a new <b>style file</b>. In the style palette, click the <img class="toolicon" src="images/document-new.png" /> button, go to the <code>tikzpaper</code> folder, and give the new style file a name, e.g. <code>sample.tikzstyles</code>. Now, we can edit the style file by clicking <img class="toolicon" src="images/text-x-generic_with_pencil.png" />. This will open the style editor:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/nostyles.png" />



<p>On the left side of the window, there is a list of node styles, followed by a list of edge styles. Currently, both lists contain only a single style, called "none". Click the "+" under the list of node styles to add a new node style, and call it <code>red dot</code>. Set the fill color to red, the draw color to black, and the shape to "circle". Then, click "+" again to add a new style called <code>green dot</code>. Set the fill color to green, the draw color to black, and again the shape to "circle".</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/node-styles.png" />

<div class="callout callout-info">
<p><b>Note:</b> You can optionally set "in TikZiT" versions of the "draw", "fill", and "shape" properties. This will make nodes or edges look different in TikZiT, but have no effect on how they are typeset. This is useful for visually distinguishing similar styles.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-info">
<p><b>Note:</b> Arrowhead expressions containing a dash (e.g. <code>-</code>, <code>-&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;-</code>, <code>|-&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;-&gt;</code>) play a special role in TikZiT. If you change them manually or use them as style names, you might get some strange behaviour. To customise the appearance of arrow heads/tails, try adding a property in the style editor called <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;</code> and setting it to <code>stealth</code>, <code>latex</code>, etc. (see the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/math/files/2013/08/tikzpgfmanual.pdf">PGF/TiKZ manual</a> for possible arrowhead styles).</p>
</div>

<p>You may also wish to add some edge styles by clicking the "+" under the list of edge styles. If you have many styles, you can also organise them into categories by setting the "Category" field. When you are done adding styles, click "Save and Close" to return to the graph editor.</p>

<p>Next is the "Properties" box. Here, you can add properties to the style which will affect the way a node or edge appears when you typeset it, but may not affect its appearance in the TikZiT GUI. Properties come in two flavours: normal properties, which have a name and a value (e.g. <code>line width=1pt</code>) and atoms, which only have a name (e.g. <code>ultra thick</code>). You can add a normal property by clicking "+" under the Properties box and an atom by clicking "+a".</p>

<p>Any valid PGF/TikZ is fair game for properties, and there are tons of ways to customise the appearance of nodes and edges this way (e.g. making them thick or thin, have crazy shapes, gradients, dashes and dots, brackets, ...). The best way to find what you need is by looking in the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/math/files/2013/08/tikzpgfmanual.pdf">PGF/TiKZ manual</a> or finding examples on <a href="https://texample.net/tikz/examples/">texample.net</a>, the <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX StackExchange</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Now, you will see your new styles in the style palette on the right. To apply a style to a node (or edge), select the node (or edge) it and double-click on the style. If you create new nodes and edges with a certain style selected, they will automatically get that style. To turn nodes these back into invisible nodes, select them and double-click on the "none" style.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/fig.png" />

<p>The above figure was created with 5 invisible nodes (2 inputs, 2 outputs, and 1 for the equals sign), 2 "red dot" nodes, and 2 "green dot" nodes.</p>


<a name="typesetting" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Typesetting in LaTeX</h2>

<p>We can now save the figure we created and include it directly in a paper. At the beginning of the tutorial, we created a new folder called <code>tikzpaper</code> containing nothing but <a href="tikzit.sty">tikzit.sty</a> a sub-directory called <code>figures</code>. In TikZiT, click <code>File > Save As...</code>, navigate to <code>tikzpaper/figures</code>, and save or newly-created figure as <code>fig1.tikz</code>.</p>

<p>In a tex(t) editor, create a new file in the <code>tikzpaper</code> folder called <code>paper.tex</code>, and add the following tex:</p>

{% highlight latex %}

% paper.tex

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikzit}
\input{sample.tikzstyles}

\begin{document}

A tikz picture as an equation:
\begin{equation}
  \tikzfig{fig1}
\end{equation}

A centered tikz picture:
\ctikzfig{fig1}

\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

<p><code>tikzfig.sty</code> provides two macros for including <code>.tikz</code> files: <code>\tikzfig</code> and <code>\ctikzfig</code>. They both take as an argument the name of a figure (without the <code>.tikz</code> extension), and will search for that figure either in the same directory or in a subdirectly called <code>figures</code> if it exists. Use <code>\tikzfig{FIG}</code> to include <code>FIG.tikz</code> inline or as part of an equation. Use <code>\ctikzfig{FIG}</code> to include <code>FIG.tikz</code> centered on its own line.</p>

<div class="callout callout-info">
<p><b>Note:</b> Inline TikZ figures align the origin (0,0) to the center of the text line by default, so it's a good idea to always center TikZ pictures on the origin (as indicated by the slightly darker grid lines). This can be tweaked by setting the <code>baseline</code> or <code>yshift</code> properties of the TikZ figure, e.g. <code>\begin{tikzpicture}[yshift=-1mm] ...</code>.</p>
</div>

<p>Use <code>pdflatex</code> to build <code>paper.tex</code>, and you should get something that looks like this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/pdf.png" />


<a name="preview" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Previewing diagrams in TikZiT</h2>

<p>Starting with TikZiT 2.1, it is possible to preview your figures directly in TikZiT by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/preview.png" />

<p>If you get a green checkmark, the preview was generated successfully. Otherwise, you can click on the <code>Output</code> tab in the Preview window to see what went wrong.</p>

<div class="callout callout-info">
<p><b>Note:</b> TikZiT will try to find <code>pdflatex</code> automatically by first searching your system path then common installation locations for TeX. If it fails, you can set the location of <code>pdflatex</code> manually in <code>Tools > Preferences</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>tikzit > Preferences</code> (macOS).</p>
</div>

<a name="custom" class="anchor"></a>

<h3>Adding custom LaTeX code to previews</h3>

<p>TikZiT automatically includes <a href="tikzit.sty">tikzit.sty</a> and the active <code>*.tikzstyles</code> file when it generates its preview. So, in the example above, <code>sample.tikzstyles</code> is included automatically. TikZiT will also search the same directory for a <code>*.tikzdefs</code> file with the same name as the active TikZ style file and include it, if it exists. This file can be used to include extra packages, define macros, set up custom PGF/TikZ shapes, etc.</p>

<p>For example, if the active TikZ style file is called <code>sample.tikzstyles</code>, create a new file called <code>sample.tikzdefs</code> in the same directory as <code>sample.tikzstyles</code> with the following LaTeX source:</p>

{% highlight latex %}

% sample.tikzdefs

\usepackage{bm}
\newcommand{\param}[1]{\ensuremath{\vec{\bm{#1}}}}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>This file loads the LaTeX package <code>bm</code> and defines a new macro <code>\param</code>, which can be used TikZ pictures. Back in TikZiT, double-click a node and set the label to, e.g. <code>\param{\alpha}</code>, and hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> again. TikZiT will automaticall find <code>sample.tikzdefs</code> and include it when it makes the preview:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/preview-macro.png" />

<p>To make this macro available in your paper, as well as the preview, add <code>\input{sample.tikzdefs}</code> to the preamble:</p>

{% highlight latex %}

% paper.tex

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikzit}
\input{sample.tikzstyles}
\input{sample.tikzdefs}

\begin{document}

% ...

{% endhighlight %}

<div class="callout callout-info">
<p><b>Note:</b> The use of <code>*.tikzstyles</code> and <code>*.tikzdefs</code> files in the preview replaces the 'Custom Preambles' feature from TikZiT 1.</p>
</div>

<a name="export" class="anchor"></a>

<h3>Exporting images</h3>

<p>After you generate a preview, you can export the image to a file or the clipboard by right-clicking on the preview itself and selecting the appropriate option.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/export.png" />

<p>If you select <code>Export Image...</code>, the Export Image dialog will be shown, where you can choose where to save the file, as well as its size and format. For the format, you can choose to save either PNG, JPG, or the original PDF file generated by <code>pdflatex</code>. To obtain SVG output, it is recommended that you export to PDF, then use a vector graphics utility such as <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> to convert to SVG.</p>


<a name="tips" class="anchor"></a>

<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>

<p>There are quite a few tricks to getting things to look nice in TikZiT, usually using a combination of PGF/TikZ hackery and invisible nodes. Here are a quick tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right-clicking on blank space with the <code>Select</code> tool active will create a node. Right-clicking and dragging between nodes will create edges.</li>
  <li>To get dashed edges, add the atom "dashed" to an edge style. That is, select an edge style in the style editor, click "+a" under properties and change the text "new atom" to "dashed".</li>
  <li>For very large or unusual shapes, sometimes it is easier to just draw the shape with invisible nodes and bezier edges.</li>
  <li>Hold down <kbd>shift</kbd> while moving the mouse wheel or two-finger scrolling to pan and hold down <kbd>ctrl</kbd> to zoom. If your mouse wheel only scrolls vertically, hold down <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> while moving the wheel to scroll horizontally.</li>
  <li>TikZiT style files can be edited in a text editor. The format is very simple: just a list of commands of the form <code>\tikzstyle{NAME}=[PROPERTIES]</code> (see below). This is convenient for bulk editing or merging sets of styles. After you edit a style file, click <img class="toolicon" src="images/refresh.png" /> in the style palette to refresh the styles.</li>
  <li>You can mix math and TikZ figures on the same line, e.g. <code>\[ \tikzfig{fig-lhs} \ =\ \tikzfig{fig-rhs} \]</code>. This is useful if you have long strings of equalities or re-use figures many times.</li>
  <li>To scale a whole TikZ figure up or down uniformly (including text), wrap the <code>\tikzfig</code> command in a <code>\scalebox</code>. To just scale coordinates, use the <code>scale</code>, <code>xscale</code>, or <code>yscale</code> TikZ properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following sections give some more detailed tips.</p>


<a name="paths" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Paths and filled shapes</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to treat a sequence of adjacent edges as one continuous path. For example, dashes and dots may look strange if they are applied to adjacent edges that are not part of a single path. Suppose we create an edge style called <code>big dashes</code> in the style editor with the following properties:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/big-dashes-style.png" />

<p>Then, we can make a complex shape using blank nodes and edges. Unfortunately the output doesn't look so good:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/path-bad.png" />

<p>Yuck! The super-long dashes happen because TikZ doesn't know these edges are all part of one path. To fix this, select all of the edges by holding the <code>CTRL</code> key and clicking each of them, then go to <code>Edit > Path > Make Path</code> or hit <code>CTRL+P</code>. Now, you should notice two things. First, if you click on any of the edges, the whole path becomes selected. Second, the output looks a lot better:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/path-good.png" />

<p>Perhaps more importantly, you can use edge styles to create <b>filled paths</b>. To do this, go to an edge style in the style editor, uncheck <code>none</code> next to fill colour, and set the colour just like you would for a node:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/edge-fill.png" />

<p>The fill colour is shown in the bottom half of the edge style's icon in the style palette. If we save the style and preview again, this is the result:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/path-fill.png" />

<p>If you want to split a path back into individual edges, go to <code>Edit > Path > Split Path</code> or hit <code>CTRL+SHIFT+P</code>. Note that if a fill colour is set, it may still appear under curved edges in the output, even though it doesn't show up in TikZiT.</p>



<a name="bend" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Keyboard shortcuts for edge bending</h2>

<p>If you select an edge and hold down the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key, you will notice a <code>&lt;&gt;</code> symbol appear above one endpoint of the edge. If you use the left and right arrow keys, this adjust the in-angle of the edge. If you hold <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd>, the other end of the edge will highlight and you can adjust the out-angle similarly. In either case, the up and down arrows adjust the looseness of the edge.</p>


<a name="source" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Editing TikZ source (e.g. node and edge properties)</h2>


<p>With a node/edge selected, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> to jump to that line of the TikZ source.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/tikz-source.png" />

<p>You can edit this by hand, and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> to update the graph editor with the new TikZ code. You need to be a bit careful, since TikZiT only understands a subset of TikZ, but adding and removing TikZ properties on nodes or edges works just fine. For this, the <a href="http://www.texample.net/media/pgf/builds/pgfmanualCVS2012-11-04.pdf">PGF/TikZ manual</a> is your friend.</p>

<p>If you can't get the TikZ code to parse again, or you decide you didn't want to make a change after all, you can revert your changes to the TikZ code by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>.</p>

<a name="label" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Adding labels next to nodes</h2>

<p>Normally labels added by double-clicking a node will appear inside the node. However, you can add a label next to a node by selecting the node, pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> and adding a <code>label</code> property to the node in the TikZ source. Once you set a label this way, it will be shown above the node in TikZiT:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/outer-label.png" />

<p>The label property is typically given in the form <code>label={POSITION:TEXT}</code>, where <code>TEXT</code> can be any LaTeX code, just like with normal labels. The label property in the example above is set to <code>label={above:1}</code>. This places the text <code>1</code> directly above the node. Possiblities for <code>POSITION</code> include <code>above</code>, <code>below</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>auto</code> (see the PGF manual for details). Note the <code>POSITION</code> only affects where the label will be typeset. For simplicity, TikZiT always shows the label above the node.</p>


<a name="merge" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Merging nodes</h2>

<p>Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd> to merge selected nodes with any nodes that are at the same location. A particularly handy use-case is in making symmetric figures. For example, suppose we want to make a box with two, symmetric input wires. Make the first input wire, then select the box and the first input:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/merge1.png" />

<p>Then, make a copy of this part of the diagram using the clipboard, and vertically with <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>&#9660;</kbd>:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/merge3.png" />

<p>Drag the duplicated part into place, and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/merge4.png" />

<p>...and we have one node with 2 inputs. Note that you might not visually see any change when you merge, but jumping to the TikZ source, we see there is indeed only one node in the middle.</p>



<a name="boxes" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Making boxes with multiple input/output wires</h2>

<p>For string diagrams, flowcharts, etc. one often wants to create boxes with multiple input and output wires. While TikZ has a notion of "anchors" which support this, I find the following technique more convenient.</p>

<p>TikZiT always draws nodes on top of edges, so to draw boxes with multiple inputs and outputs, first create one or more node styles for boxes. To get large boxes, click the "+" button under the property list and set the <code>minimum width</code> and <code>minimum height</code> properties. (Double-click a property or its value to change it.)</p>

<p>For example: a medium-sized box (2-3 inputs and outputs), drawn horizontally, looks pretty good with <code>minimum width</code> set to <code>0.75cm</code> and <code>minimum height</code> set to <code>1cm</code>.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/box.png" />

<p>Now, add nodes with the <code>medium box</code> style where you wish to put boxes. For example, here are two such boxes, labeled <code>$f$</code> and <code>$g$</code>:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/nowires.png" />

<p>Then, create invisible nodes for inputs and outputs and draw edges to wire them together, getting a figure that looks like this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/wires.png" />

<p>The final typeset figure will then come out like this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/typeset-boxes.png" />

<p>While it might seem a bit awkward to create styles for every possible size, in practice this isn't too bad, for 2 reasons:</p>

  <li>If you need a custom size as a one-off, you can use the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> trick from before to set the property on a single node.</li>
  <li>Having only a few sizes to choose from (e.g. <code>small box</code>, <code>medium box</code>, <code>large box</code>) imposes some discipline on how you make your figures, and creates more consistent-looking papers overall. (This made a big difference <a href="http://cambridge.org/pqp">here</a>!)</li>

<p>Suppose later on we come to our senses and decide to draw figures from bottom-to-top rather than left-to-right. To do this, first swap the minimum height/width values in the style editor. That is, set <code>minimum width</code> to <code>1cm</code> and <code>minimum height</code> to <code>0.75cm</code>. Then, with our figure open, hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> to select everything and <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#9666;</kbd> to rotate counter-clockwise. Then we get this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/boxfig-ccw.png" />

<p>which typesets as:</p>

<p>Then, suppose <i>even</i> later on our annoying co-author insists figures go from top-to-bottom rather than bottom-to-top. To fix this, hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> to select everything again and <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>&#9660;</kbd> to flip vertically. Then we get a new TikZ figure, which typesets as:</p>

<h2>Using texopen.py to open TiKZ from PDFs</h2>

<p>Many PDF readers have a <i>reverse lookup</i> feature, which enables you to jump to a line of Tex code when e.g. double-clicking a point in the generated PDF document. Normally, you want the line of TeX to be displayed in your main text editor or LaTeX editor, but if you click on a part of the PDF which came from a <code>\tikzfig</code>, it is convenient for this to open directly in TikZiT.</p>

<p>This can be done via the following python script, <a href="texopen.py">texopen.py</a>:

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
import subprocess

if len(sys.argv) >= 3:
  file = sys.argv[1]
  line = sys.argv[2]

  print(file)
  print(line)

  if file.endswith('.tikz'):
    subprocess.call(['tikzit', file])
  else:
    subprocess.call(['subl', file + ':' + line])
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Note this script uses <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> as the default editor (hence <code>subl</code> in the last line above). Obviously you can customise this to use your preferred editor.</p>

<p>To use this script, place it somewhere that your PDF viewer can find, and set it up as your 'editor'. For example, in Okular, go to <code>Settings &gt; Configure Okular...</code>. Click on the Editor tab, select 'Custom Text Editor' and add the following as the command: <code>texopen.py %f %l</code>. Here, the <code>%f</code> is a placeholder for the active file, and <code>%l</code> the line of code.</p>

<p>Configuration in other popular PDF editors (e.g. Preview, Skim, Sumatra) should be similar. On Windows systems, you will probably want to set the editor as something like <code>C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\texopen.py %f %l</code>.</p>


<p>For reverse lookups to work, make sure you are building with synctex enabled. This happens automatically if you are using a tool like <a href="https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html">Latexmk</a> or various GUI LaTeX editors or plugins. You will typically see a file with an extension like <code>*.synctex.gz</code> being generated when you build.</p>

<h1>File Formats</h1>

<p>TikZiT's <code>.tikz</code> and <code>.tikzstyle</code> file formats are both subsets of PGF/TikZ's TeX-based format. TikZ style files have a very simple format. They are just a list of <code>\tikzstyle</code> commands. Here is the full grammar:</p>

{% highlight xml %}

<tikzstyles>   ::= ("\tikzstyle" DELIMITED_STRING "=" "[" <properties> "]")*

<properties>   ::= "[" <property> ("," <property>)* "]"

<property>     ::= <value> "=" <value> | <value>

<value>        ::= SIMPLE_STRING | DELIMITED_STRING

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Where <code>SIMPLE_STRING</code> means a string consisting of letters, numbers, and whitespace and <code>DELIMITED_STRING</code> means a string inside of curly braces. The latter can contain nested curly braces, provided they occur in matched pairs.</p>


<p>TikZ figure files consist of a <code>{tikzpicture}</code> environment, in which there is a list of <code>\node</code> commands, followed by a list of <code>\edge</code> commands. Nodes and edges, as well as the figure as a whole can have properties. Here is the full grammar:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<tikzpicture>  ::= "\begin{tikzpicture}" <properties>?
                   <expression>*
                   "\end{tikzpicture}"

<expression>   ::= <ignore> | <node> | <edge> | <boundingbox>

<ignore>       ::= "\begin{pgfonlayer}" DELIMITED_STRING |
                    "\end{pgfonlayer}"

<properties>   ::= "[" <property> ("," <property>)* "]"

<property>     ::= <value> "=" <value> | <value>

<value>        ::= SIMPLE_STRING | DELIMITED_STRING

<node>         ::= "\node" <properties>? <nodename>
                      "at" <coords> DELIMITED_STRING ";"

<nodename>     ::= "(" (SIMPLE_STRING) (".center")? ")"

<coords>       ::= "(" NUMBER "," NUMBER ")"

<edge>         ::= "\draw" <properties>? <nodename>
                      "to" <edgenode>? (<nodename> | "()") ";"

<edgenode>     ::= "node" <properties>? DELIMITED_STRING

<boundingbox>  ::= "\path" "[use as bounding box]" <coords>
                      "rectangle" <coords> ";"
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <p><b>Note:</b> TikZiT 2.x currently does not use the bounding box command, but it is allowed for compatibility with TikZiT 1 files.</p>
