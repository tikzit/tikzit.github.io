  <h1>TikZiT</h1>
  <p>TikZiT is a super simple GUI editor for graphs and string diagrams. Its native file format is a subset of PGF/TikZ, which means TikZiT files can be included directly in papers typeset using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. Pre-built versions are available for 64-bit systems running Windows, Linux, or macOS. Alternatively, you can build TikZiT from source (via GitHub).</p>

<h1>Install</h1>


<p><b>Windows:</b> Click 'Windows (exe)' above to download a zip file and extract it to a convenient place (e.g. <code>C:\tikzit</code>). If you wish to associate <code>.tikz</code> files with TikZiT, run the included <code>.reg</code> file (optional). Note you may need to edit the <code>.reg</code> file with a text editor if you place TikZiT in a different location.</p>

<p><b>Linux:</b> Click 'Linux (portable binary)' above to download a tarball and extract it to a convient place (e.g. your home directory). Then, launch the application with <code>~/tikzit/bin/tikzit</code> (assuming you extracted into your home directory). You may wish to add <code>~/tikzit/bin</code> to your PATH and install the application launcher and file associations by running <code>./install-local.sh</code> from inside the TikZiT directory.</p>

<p><b>macOS:</b> Click 'macOS (dmg)' above to download a dmg file. Open this file and copy <code>tikzit.app</code> to your Applications folder. Depending on your system settings, the first time you run TikZiT, you may need to right-click the <code>.app</code> file and select <code>Open</code> from the menu to get the option to run it. After this, you can run TikZiT like a normal application.</p>

<div class="callout callout-warning">
  <p><b>Note:</b> The version of TikZiT above requires at least macOS version 10.11 (Yosemite). If you are running an older version of macOS (10.8-10.10), use <a href="https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit/releases/download/v2.0/tikzit-osx-mountain.dmg">this version</a> instead.</p>
</div>


<a name="quickstart" class="anchor"></a>

<h1>Quickstart</h1>

<p>While TikZiT is easy to use, a few things might not be obvious the first time you run the program. This guide should get you going as quickly as possible. <b>For mac users:</b> throughout this tutorial, substitute <kbd>ctrl</kbd> = <kbd>command</kbd> and <kbd>alt</kbd> = <kbd>option</kbd>, as usual.</p>

<p>This tutorial will cover basic editing all the way up to building a LaTeX paper with TikZiT figures in it. Create a new, empty folder somewhere on your computer (which I will refer to as <code>tikzpaper</code> throughout this tutorial). Download <a href="tikzit.sty">tikzit.sty</a> and place it in the folder. Also, create a new sub-directory called <code>figures</code>, which we will use later.</p>

<a name="editing" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Basic node and edge editing</h2>

<p>When you open TikZiT for the first time, you will see something that looks like this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/fresh.png" />

<p>The window is divided into two parts: the main part is the <b>graph editor</b> and the part along the side is the <b>style palette</b>. For editing graphs, there are 3 tools: the <b>select</b> tool, the add <b>node</b> tool, and the add <b>edge</b> tool. These can be selected quickly by pressing <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, or <kbd>e</kbd> while the graph editor is in focus.</p>

<p>Pick the <b>node</b> tool and click on the graph a few times to add some nodes. You will notice these appear in TikZiT as dashed circles with a small dot in the middle. These are called <b>invisible nodes</b>. These will not appear in the actual typeset output. However, they can be labelled with pieces of LaTeX code (see below), which will appear in your figure, or used to attach edges. To add edges, select the <b>edge</b> tool and click and drag from one node to another.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/add-edge.png" />

<p>Pick the <b>select</b> tool again. You can select individual nodes or edges by clicking on them. You can select multiple nodes by dragging a box around the, and you can select multiple nodes or edges by clicking while holding down the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key.</p>

<p>Selected nodes can be moved by dragging the mouse, or by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys. Nodes are locked on a grid, so they normally only move in increments of 0.25 in TikZ coordinates. However, they can be "nudged" by increments of 0.025 by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + arrow keys. This is convenient e.g. for centering nodes between others (5 nudges = 1/2 normal grid cell).</p>

<p>Double-clicking a node gives the ability to set a label, which can contain LaTeX code:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/node-label.png" />

<p>Clicking on an edge reveals extra controls for bending the edge. There are two kinds of bend-modes in TikZiT, the <i>basic bend</i> mode (blue controls). Dragging either of the control points will cause the edge to bend to the left or the right:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/basic-bend.png" />

<p>Double-clicking the edge will change it to <i>bezier bend</i> mode (green controls). Now, each of the control points can be dragged independently:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/bezier-bend.png" />


<a name="styles" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Adding styles</h2>

<p>Before we can create non-invisible nodes, we will need some styles. To set up styles, we will first create a new <b>style file</b>. In the style palette, click the <img class="toolicon" src="images/document-new.png" /> button, go to the <code>tikzpaper</code> folder, and give the new style file a name, e.g. <code>sample.tikzstyles</code>. Now, we can edit the style file by clicking <img class="toolicon" src="images/text-x-generic_with_pencil.png" />. This will open the style editor:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/nostyles.png" />



<p>On the left side of the window, there is a list of node styles, followed by a list of edge styles. Currently, both lists contain only a single style, called "none". Click the "+" under the list of node styles to add a new node style, and call it <code>red dot</code>. Set the fill color to red, the draw color to black, and the shape to "circle". Then, click "+" again to add a new style called <code>green dot</code>. Set the fill color to green, the draw color to black, and again the shape to "circle".</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/node-styles.png" />

<div class="callout callout-info">
<p><b>Note:</b> You can optionally set "in TikZiT" versions of the "draw", "fill", and "shape" properties. This will make nodes or edges look different in TikZiT, but have no effect on how they are typeset. This is useful for visually distinguishing similar styles.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also wish to add some edge styles by clicking the "+" under the list of edge styles. If you have many styles, you can also organise them into categories by setting the "Category" field. When you are done adding styles, click "Save and Close" to return to the graph editor.</p>

<p>Now, you will see your new styles in the style palette on the right. To apply a style to a node (or edge), select the node (or edge) it and double-click on the style. If you create new nodes and edges with a certain style selected, they will automatically get that style. To turn nodes these back into invisible nodes, select them and double-click on the "none" style.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/fig.png" />

<p>The above figure was created with 5 invisible nodes (2 inputs, 2 outputs, and 1 for the equals sign), 2 "red dot" nodes, and 2 "green dot" nodes.</p>


<a name="typesetting" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Typesetting in LaTeX</h2>

<p>We can now save the figure we created and include it directly in a paper. At the beginning of the tutorial, we created a new folder called <code>tikzpaper</code> containing nothing but <a href="tikzit.sty">tikzit.sty</a> a sub-directory called <code>figures</code>. In TikZiT, click <code>File > Save As...</code>, navigate to <code>tikzpaper/figures</code>, and save or newly-created figure as <code>fig1.tikz</code>.</p>

<p>In a tex(t) editor, create a new file in the <code>tikzpaper</code> folder called <code>paper.tex</code>, and add the following tex:</p>

{% highlight latex %}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikzit}
\input{sample.tikzstyles}

\begin{document}

A tikz picture as an equation:
\begin{equation}
  \tikzfig{fig1}
\end{equation}

A centered tikz picture:
\ctikzfig{fig1}

\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

<p><code>tikzfig.sty</code> provides two macros for including <code>.tikz</code> files: <code>\tikzfig</code> and <code>\ctikzfig</code>. They both take as an argument the name of a figure (without the <code>.tikz</code> extension), and will search for that figure either in the same directory or in a subdirectly called <code>figures</code> if it exists. Use <code>\tikzfig{FIG}</code> to include <code>FIG.tikz</code> inline or as part of an equation. Use <code>\ctikzfig{FIG}</code> to include <code>FIG.tikz</code> centered on its own line.</p>

<div class="callout callout-info">
<p><b>Note:</b> Inline TikZ figures align the origin (0,0) to the center of the text line by default, so it's a good idea to always center TikZ pictures on the origin (as indicated by the slightly darker grid lines). This can be tweaked by setting the <code>baseline</code> or <code>yshift</code> properties of the TikZ figure, e.g. <code>\begin{tikzpicture}[yshift=-1mm] ...</code>.</p>
</div>

<p>Use <code>pdflatex</code> to build <code>paper.tex</code>, and you should get something that looks like this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/pdf.png" />

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <p><b>Note:</b> TikZiT and LaTex don't always agree on how named colours (e.g. "green") should be drawn. This is a <a href="https://github.com/tikzit/tikzit/issues/19">known issue</a>, which will get fixed at some point.</p>
</div>


<a name="tips" class="anchor"></a>

<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>

<p>There are quite a few tricks to getting things to look nice in TikZiT, usually using a combination of PGF/TikZ hackery and invisible nodes. Here are a quick tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To get dashed edges, add the atom "dashed" to an edge style. That is, select an edge style in the style editor, click "+a" under properties and change the text "new atom" to "dashed".</li>
  <li>For very large or unusual shapes, sometimes it is easier to just draw the shape with invisible nodes and bezier edges.</li>
  <li>Hold down <kbd>shift</kbd> while moving the mouse wheel or two-finger scrolling to pan and hold down <kbd>ctrl</kbd> to zoom. If your mouse wheel only scrolls vertically, hold down <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> while moving the wheel to scroll horizontally.</li>
  <li>TikZiT style files can be edited in a text editor. The format is very simple: just a list of commands of the form <code>\tikzstyle{NAME}=[PROPERTIES]</code> (see below). This is convenient for bulk editing or merging sets of styles. After you edit a style file, click <img class="toolicon" src="images/refresh.png" /> in the style palette to refresh the styles.</li>
  <li>You can mix math and TikZ figures on the same line, e.g. <code>\[ \tikzfig{fig-lhs} \ =\ \tikzfig{fig-rhs} \]</code>. This is useful if you have long strings of equalities or re-use figures many times.</li>
  <li>To scale a whole TikZ figure up or down uniformly (including text), wrap the <code>\tikzfig</code> command in a <code>\scalebox</code>. To just scale coordinates, use the <code>scale</code>, <code>xscale</code>, or <code>yscale</code> TikZ properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following sections give some more detailed tips.</p>

<a name="source" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Editing TikZ source (e.g. node and edge properties)</h2>


<p>With a node/edge selected, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> to jump to that line of the TikZ source.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/tikz-source.png" />

<p>You can edit this by hand, and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> to update the graph editor with the new TikZ code. You need to be a bit careful, since TikZiT only understands a subset of TikZ, but adding and removing TikZ properties on nodes or edges works just fine. For this, the <a href="http://www.texample.net/media/pgf/builds/pgfmanualCVS2012-11-04.pdf">PGF/TikZ manual</a> is your friend.</p>


<a name="boxes" class="anchor"></a>

<h2>Making boxes with multiple input/output wires</h2>

<p>For string diagrams, flowcharts, etc. one often wants to create boxes with multiple input and output wires. While TikZ has a notion of "anchors" which support this, I find the following technique more convenient.</p>

<p>TikZiT always draws nodes on top of edges, so to draw boxes with multiple inputs and outputs, first create one or more node styles for boxes. To get large boxes, click the "+" button under the property list and set the <code>minimum width</code> and <code>minimum height</code> properties. (Double-click a property or its value to change it.)</p>

<p>For example: a medium-sized box (2-3 inputs and outputs), drawn horizontally, looks pretty good with <code>minimum width</code> set to <code>0.75cm</code> and <code>minimum height</code> set to <code>1cm</code>.</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/box.png" />

<p>Now, add nodes with the <code>medium box</code> style where you wish to put boxes. For example, here are two such boxes, labeled <code>$f$</code> and <code>$g$</code>:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/nowires.png" />

<p>Then, create invisible nodes for inputs and outputs and draw edges to wire them together, getting a figure that looks like this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/wires.png" />

<p>The final typeset figure will then come out like this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/typeset-boxes.png" />

<p>While it might seem a bit awkward to create styles for every possible size, in practice this isn't too bad, for 2 reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you need a custom size as a one-off, you can use the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> trick from before to set the property on a single node.</li>
  <li>Having only a few sizes to choose from (e.g. <code>small box</code>, <code>medium box</code>, <code>large box</code>) imposes some discipline on how you make your figures, and creates more consistent-looking papers overall. (This made a big difference <a href="http://cambridge.org/pqp">here</a>!)</li>
</ol>

<p>Suppose later on we come to our senses and decide to draw figures from bottom-to-top rather than left-to-right. To do this, first swap the minimum height/width values in the style editor. That is, set <code>minimum width</code> to <code>1cm</code> and <code>minimum height</code> to <code>0.75cm</code>. Then, with our figure open, hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> to select everything and <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#9666;</kbd> to rotate counter-clockwise. Then we get this:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/boxfig-ccw.png" />

<p>which typesets as:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/typeset-boxes2.png" />

<p>Then, suppose <i>even</i> later on our annoying co-author insists figures go from top-to-bottom rather than bottom-to-top. To fix this, hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> to select everything again and <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>&#9660;</kbd> to flip vertically. Then we get a new TikZ figure, which typesets as:</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshots/typeset-boxes3.png" />


<a name="formats" class="anchor"></a>

<h1>File Formats</h1>

<p>TikZiT's <code>.tikz</code> and <code>.tikzstyle</code> file formats are both subsets of PGF/TikZ's TeX-based format. TikZ style files have a very simple format. They are just a list of <code>\tikzstyle</code> commands. Here is the full grammar:</p>

{% highlight xml %}

<tikzstyles>   ::= ("\tikzstyle" DELIMITED_STRING "=" "[" <properties> "]")*

<properties>   ::= "[" <property> ("," <property>)* "]"

<property>     ::= <value> "=" <value> | <value>

<value>        ::= SIMPLE_STRING | DELIMITED_STRING

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Where <code>SIMPLE_STRING</code> means a string consisting of letters, numbers, and whitespace and <code>DELIMITED_STRING</code> means a string inside of curly braces. The latter can contain nested curly braces, provided they occur in matched pairs.</p>


<p>TikZ figure files consist of a <code>{tikzpicture}</code> environment, in which there is a list of <code>\node</code> commands, followed by a list of <code>\edge</code> commands. Nodes and edges, as well as the figure as a whole can have properties. Here is the full grammar:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<tikzpicture>  ::= "\begin{tikzpicture}" <properties>?
                   <expression>*
                   "\end{tikzpicture}"

<expression>   ::= <ignore> | <node> | <edge> | <boundingbox>

<ignore>       ::= "\begin{pgfonlayer}" DELIMITED_STRING |
                    "\end{pgfonlayer}"

<properties>   ::= "[" <property> ("," <property>)* "]"

<property>     ::= <value> "=" <value> | <value>

<value>        ::= SIMPLE_STRING | DELIMITED_STRING

<node>         ::= "\node" <properties>? <nodename>
                      "at" <coords> DELIMITED_STRING ";"

<nodename>     ::= "(" (SIMPLE_STRING) (".center")? ")"

<coords>       ::= "(" NUMBER "," NUMBER ")"

<edge>         ::= "\draw" <properties>? <nodename>
                      "to" <edgenode>? (<nodename> | "()") ";"

<edgenode>     ::= "node" <properties>? DELIMITED_STRING

<boundingbox>  ::= "\path" "[use as bounding box]" <coords>
                      "rectangle" <coords> ";"
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <p><b>Note:</b> TikZiT 2.0 currently does not use the bounding box command, but it is allowed for compatibility with TikZiT 1 files.</p>
</div>
